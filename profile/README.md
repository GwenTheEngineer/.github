# GwenTheEngineer

## Hi, I'm Gwen 👋

I turn imaginative ideas into real-world projects. My philosophy in life is that you just need to start, and not let perfect be the enemy of good! These project write-ups and resources are meant to inspire, teach, and lower the activation energy to go from 0 --> 1 (and also to teach my kid about design thinking and perseverance; if I can wrangle Blender, she can too.)

Curiosity is more important than simplification. Given time and interest, most people can figure out how things work and how to build them. A big part of this project is showing that the ideas we imagine can be brought to life. 

We build playful, curiosity-driven things — small robots, sensors, and the occasional soft materials engineering (aka sewing) project. Most of these start as tiny side quests and grow into experiments worth sharing.

## Project philosophy

I care about:
- building things that are approachable and fun
- sharing what works (and what doesn’t)
- keeping projects open and easy to explore
- learning in public

## Support

All projects and resources are free and open.

If this work was helpful and you'd like to support future side quests, you can buy me a coffee ☕ https://buymeacoffee.com/GwenTheEngineer

🎥 I document many of these projects on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@GwenTheEngineer

Did AI write the README so I didn't overthink it? Sure did! 

If you build something inspired by these projects, I’d love to hear about it!
