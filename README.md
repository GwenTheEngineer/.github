# GwenTheEngineer

Welcome! This is the home for my engineering side quests.

I like experimenting with:
- Robotics & simulation
- Sensors & embedded hardware
- Data analysis in Python
- Anything that seems fun or curious

I document the projects on YouTube:

This GitHub contains the resources that go with those videos:
- Code
- Parts lists
- Notes and documentation
