# GwenTheEngineer

## Hi, I'm Gwen 👋

I turn imaginative ideas into real-world projects. My philosophy in life is that you just need to start, and not let perfect be the enemy of good!

This GitHub is the workshop behind my experiments in hardware, robotics, and software.

I like building playful, curiosity-driven things — small robots, sensors, and the occasional soft materials engineering (aka sewing) project. Most of these start as tiny side quests and grow into experiments worth sharing.

🎥 I document many of these projects on YouTube:

### What you'll find here

This space contains the resources that go along with my projects and videos:

- Robotics & simulation experiments  
- Embedded and sensor projects  
- Tools and data analysis  
- Bill of materials and setup notes  
- Lessons learned along the way

Think of this as the workshop and lab notebook behind the videos.

### Project philosophy

I care about:
- building things that are approachable and fun
- sharing what works (and what doesn’t)
- keeping projects open and easy to explore
- learning in public

Did AI write the README so I didn't overthink it? Sure did! 

If you build something inspired by these projects, I’d love to hear about it!
